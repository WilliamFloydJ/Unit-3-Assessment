        <h3>Perseverance</h3>

        <p>
          I was born in a small home in the suburbs of Sacramento, California,
          with 4 older brothers. I only lived there for about 3 years before I
          moved into a nice home in Fort-Worth Texas. It was a rich
          neighborhood. Lots of middle aged folks, and quite a few kids. Yet I
          just didn't fit in. I was shy and quite. I grew up only being with my
          family, but slowly through the years my brothers moved out, leaving me
          with only my parents. Through my youth I longed to live in Utah, its
          where 90% of my family lived. Then in 2016 My dad got a job in
          Salt-Lake. We moved everything, I was happy to start a new, but
          nervous that i'd have to meat new people. Then 3 days before
          christmas, my father passed away from a sudden heart attack. That was
          the hardest time of my life. But really it humbled me. I was a 14 year
          old kid at the time, and in that short time I had to stand up take
          charge of my life. I feel like I've aged twice as fast since then. It
          was only 5 years ago, but It feels like It was an eternity ago. Stay
          strong, Never forget your worth. Never forget your purpose.

          I would describe myself as creative and adventures. Now if you ask
          someone else they'd probably say shy and awkward, but I guess it just
          depend on how you look at it.
